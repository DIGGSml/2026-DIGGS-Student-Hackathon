# 2026 DIGGS Student Hackathon 🌍⚒️

## Welcome to the DIGGS Data Innovation Challenge!


## Register Here! [https://www.geoinstitute.org/special-projects/diggs](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeITiAO227eQMIfVcVyok6AzkfcBbUBhKPjUGsNpS34GVFqxQ/viewform?usp=header)

### 🎯 Mission
Build innovative solutions using the DIGGS (Data Interchange for Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Specialists) standard to transform how we work with geotechnical data.

### 📅 Event Details
- **Start Date**: January 5, 2026
- **End Date**: March 9, 2026 (9-week challenge)
- **Format**: Open-ended team challenge
- **Awards Ceremony**: During Geo-Congress 2026 in Salt Lake City
- **Support**: Weekly DIGGS Team Office Hours
- **Objective**: Create something cool and innovative with DIGGS data!

## 🏆 Challenge Themes

### 1. 📊 Data In/Data Out
Transform how we import, export, and validate DIGGS data. Build converters, validators, or integration tools that make DIGGS data more accessible.

### 2. 🎨 Visualization
Create stunning visualizations of geotechnical data. Think interactive bore logs, 3D subsurface models, or innovative ways to display soil properties.

### 3. 🔧 Direct Design/Interpretation
Develop tools that use DIGGS data for engineering analysis, design recommendations, or automated interpretations.

### 4. 🔄  Data Transformation
Unlock siloed geotechnical data by converting between formats. Ingest legacy files, proprietary exports, and unstructured PDFs into standardized DIGGS—or export to downstream tools like GIS and CAD.

### 5. 🌐 Cross-Discipline Integration
Connect DIGGS data with other engineering disciplines.

See [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## 🛠️ What is DIGGS?

DIGGS is an XML/GML-based data transfer standard for geotechnical and geoenvironmental information. It enables organizations to:
- Share technical data efficiently
- Reduce redundant testing and drilling
- Standardize geotechnical project data
- Save millions in project costs
